<h2 id="introduction">🌟 Introduction</h2>

This repository demonstrates the use of C# Abstract through a simple console application. In this repository, abstract classes serve as blueprints for defining common characteristics and behaviors for different enemy types, such as stamina and run. By using an abstract class, a standardized blueprint for different enemy types is established, which helps reduce redundancy, enhances maintainability, and ensures a consistent interface across various enemy types.
