<h2 id="introduction">üåü Introduction</h2>

This repository demonstrates the use of C# Abstract through a simple console application. In this project, abstract classes act as blueprints for defining common characteristics and behaviours across various enemy types, such as stamina and running abilities. Using an abstract class establishes a standardized blueprint for different enemy types, which helps reduce redundancy, enhances maintainability, and ensures a consistent interface across various enemy types.
